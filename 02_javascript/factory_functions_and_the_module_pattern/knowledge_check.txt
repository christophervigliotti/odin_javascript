    How does scope work in JavaScript?
        global outside of {curly braces}
        local inside of {curly braces}
        scopes
            var     function scope
            let     block scope, varialbe
            const   block scope, constant (set once)
    What are closures and how do they help in creating private variables?
        defined 
            the combination of a function and the surrounding state in which the function was declared
            aka the 'lexical environment'
        how they help
            associate data with functions and manipulate that data anywhere outside of the enclosing function

    What common issues can you face when working with constructors?
        they donâ€™t provide automatic safeguards that prevent from using them wrong
        also 
            misusing instanceof. In other programming languages, the keyword is a reliable way to know the code with which an object was made; but in JavaScript, it checks the presence of a constructorâ€™s prototype in an objectâ€™s entire prototype chain - which does nothing to confirm if an object was made with that constructor since the constructorâ€™s prototype can even be reassigned after the creation of an object
